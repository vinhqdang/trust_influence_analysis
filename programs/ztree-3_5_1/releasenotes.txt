  character which has a place value of 1.

+ pos(s, t, x)
  Returns place number where string 't' occurs in string 's', starting the
  counting process at number 'x'.

+ lower(s)
  Returns string 's' in lower case letters.

+ trim("    s    ") 		
  Trims the outside spaces around text letters, but not spaces within the text.

+ format(x, y) 
  Returns 'x' as a string variable rounded to the precision of 'y'.

+ if(a, s, t)
  Returns string s if a evaluates to true, otherwise string t.

+ relational operators can be applied to pairs of sting expressions

Please note
-----------

* we switched to a new programming environment (compiler, class library and
  parser generator), please test your treatments thoroughly
